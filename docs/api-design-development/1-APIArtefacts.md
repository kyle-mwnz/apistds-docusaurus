## API Artefacts

There are some fundamental artefacts which comprise an API deliverable:

-   Interface specification, accessible via some form of catalogue

-   API code and policies

-   Tests

-   Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the API, identifying performance,
    availability etc.

These artefacts are the responsibility of the API developer and should
be mandated as a minimum set of deliverables when developing an API. All
of these artefacts must be managed in a source code management system
(SCM) so that changes can be tracked and collaborative development can
be performed.
