### Customer X-HTTP Headers

X- notation headers have been deprecated as per
[[RFC6648]{.underline}](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648)[^1] and
should not be used. This standard appreciates that X- notation headers
are widely used however this document recommends that where an agency is
defining a custom header the X- notation should not be used and the
agency defines a custom header notation that is relevant. For example,
*X-Request-Id* should be redefined as *Request-Id*.
