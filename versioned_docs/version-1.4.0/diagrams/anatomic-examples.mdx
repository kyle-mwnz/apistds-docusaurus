# Anatomic library

Te Whatu Ora has an NPM package for a shared design library.

We can use these React components within the markdown files themselves.

```mdx-code-block
import { ThemeProvider, Container, Text, Button, Alert } from '@te-whatu-ora/anatomic';
import { myCovidRecord } from '@te-whatu-ora/anatomic-themes';
import '@te-whatu-ora/anatomic/styles';

<ThemeProvider theme={myCovidRecord.className}>
  <Container>
    <Button variant="primary">Primary button</Button>
    <Alert variant="cautionary">This is a My Covid Record Style alert</Alert>
  </Container>
</ThemeProvider>
```

They can also be used for creating full pages.
